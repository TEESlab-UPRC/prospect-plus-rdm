# Recommendations-Decision Matrix Tool
[PROSPECT+](https://h2020prospect.eu/) [Recommendations-Decision Matrix tool](https://rdmtool.teeslab.unipi.gr/), powered by [TEESlab](https://teeslab.unipi.gr/).

## Requirements
- PHP 8.1
### For development & building
- Node.js (>=16, latest LTS recommended)
- Composer

## Setup
```sh
composer install
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```
Make a DB and update [.env](.env) as needed.
```sh
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

## Development
### Debugging
```sh
php artisan serve
npm run dev
```
Test by connecting to the Artisan server. For debugging the PHP side, XDebug can be used (+ PHP Debug plugin, if on VS Code).  
Vite should hot reload parts of the app, as files get changed (note: if using WSL2, this might not trigger, if the workspace is stored on Windows' hard drives, instead of inside WSL's FS).

### DB migrations
set up/upgrade DB: `php artisan migrate`  
reset DB: `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`  
add DB table: `php artisan make:migration create_<name>_table --create=<name>`  
alter DB table: `php artisan make:migration <change>_<name>_table --table=<name>`

### DB seeding
run seeders: `php artisan db:seed`  
new seeder: `php artisan make:seeder <name>`  
_for the seeder to be called, it has to be executed via [DatabaseSeeder](database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php)'s run function, using the call method, like so:_
```php
$this->call([
    ...,
    <name>::class,
]);
```

### i18n
Translations in PHP: `__($key, $replacements)`  
Text Translations in JS: `t(key, replacements)`  
HTML Translations in React element properties: `{...tHTML(key, replacements)}`  
_see [resources/js/Helpers/TransHelpers.js](resources/js/Helpers/TransHelpers.js)_

The language files are in JSON and in [lang](lang).  
They can automatically be added to and translated using the following commands:
- Auto-add simple entries (from code & DB) and translate lang files: `php artisan lang:gen`
- Add new EN entry, no translation: `php artisan lang:add <langKey>`
- Translate lang files from EN: `php artisan lang:translate <engine> <lang>`

Automatic translations require a DeepL API key and a Google Cloud Translation API key to be set in [.env](.env).  
Extra settings for the automatic translations can be found in [config/autotranslate.php](config/autotranslate.php).

## Building & deploying
Adjust [.env](.env) accordingly.
```sh
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-plugins --no-scripts # for automations, also: --no-ansi --no-interaction --no-progress
npm run build
```
The web server should serve [public](public/).

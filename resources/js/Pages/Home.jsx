                    Innovative financing is an option for urban climate and sustainable development projects,
                    but cities, municipalities and regions need to know how to activate and use it.
                    The Recommendation-Decision Matrix tool is working to that effect!

                    The <b>Recommendation-Decision Matrix tool</b> is designed to support local governments on their <b>first
                    decision-making steps</b> against a wide array of <b>innovative schemes</b> for financing their climate and
                    sustainability actions. A <b>practical</b> and <b>easy-to-use tool</b>, <b>free</b> and <b>accessible</b> to all local and regional
                    authorities and their implementing agencies, who are looking at ways to increase or diversify their funding base
                    in order to bridge their municipal infrastructure needs across <b> 5 different sectors:</b>

                <p>
                    For each <b>specific scheme</b> an easy-to-grasp checklist of selected decision criteria identifies an <b>ease of implementation
                    rate (%)</b>, based on the <b>project-specific characteristics</b> and the <b>general framework conditions</b>.

                    process and can also serve as a <b>stand-alone capacity building resource</b> enabling a concise overview of new and innovative
                    financing instruments and an interpretation of their mechanisms and areas of application.
